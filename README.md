# Seol-Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction
The goal of the project is to predict number of rental bikes required at each hour for stable supply of rental bikes. Various Regression machine learning algorithms have been applied on the dataset to get the best possible prediction. Some of the key takeaways from this project are -

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the data to gain some insights. 2.Treated the outliers using square root transformation.

3.Label encoding was done for categorical variables. 

4.Applied 6 machine learning models on the dataset i.e,

Linear Regresson.

Polynomial Regresson.

Ridge Regression.

Lasso Regression.

Decision Tree.

Decision Tree with cross-validation


5.Polynmial Regression Model performed best among the five models with test R2 score of 87.70 %.
